Adoption of In-Paddock Feeding of Methane Inhibitors in Pasture-Based Dairy: An Application of the ADOPT model and a Farm-Level Cost-Benefit Analysis

This repository is a way to house the economic modelling of my masters thesis undertaken at the University of Waikato 2021-2022. This modelling is undertaken in an excel workbook, and the intention was to eventually shift the model into R. Unfortunately due to time constraints this did not occur, but GitHub is still a good way to make the modelling available to any readers of my thesis.

A shortened URL to this repo is: tinyurl.com/z2uyd2fs 

If you happen to stumble upon this repo without the thesis that describes the model and you would like to read it you can find it here:
